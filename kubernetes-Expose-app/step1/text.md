Deployment:

Use nginx images to create a kubernetes deployment

expose deployment to the publicly accessable ex `you can use nodeport as a type`

Now access Nginx using this link:

[ACCESS NGINX]({{TRAFFIC_HOST1_80}})

It's also possible to access ports using the top-right navigation in the terminal.
Or we can display the link to that page:

[ACCESS PORTS]({{TRAFFIC_SELECTOR}})
